I ran the server with: mongod --dbpath ~/mongodb_data
(Of course, after creating a directory for the server data and installing mongoose)
I ran the website with: npm start

Functionalities I couldn't implement due to time limitations (I was initially getting errors from backend to frontend connections which cost me a lot of time) include: editing todo's that are already uploaded to the database, and toggling to check completion.

What Works: Adding todo's and deleting todo's.
